          My career quickly took shape when I co-founded <a href="http://typework.com/" target="_blank" title="Typework">Typework</a> with three friends.
          We started with building products for startups and bigger companies with the ambition to eventually come up with our own product.
          This ambition quickly became real when we started creating value in hospitals. In the end we came up with a product for dialysis centers.
          When I felt my job was done I decided to start a new challenge and started working as a freelancer and product designer at Lightspeed.
          <br>
          <br>
          My ambition is building things that matter with a strong focus on usability and simplicity.
          I've open sourced some small tools that help me during my own design process on <a href="http://github.com/nielsenramon" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
          Next to that I am currently helping out with the best developer-friendly Ruby on Rails CMS out there, <a href="https://github.com/locomotivecms" title="LocomotiveCMS" target="_blank">LocomotiveCMS</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          During the previous years I worked with many clients and teams like: Sweeten, GreenPan, InSilico DB, Niko Group, Intuo, European Resuscitation Council and many more.
          Two of the apps I've designed were selected by iMinds, a prestigious startup accelerator in belgium.
          I share my work on <a href="https://dribbble.com/nielsenramon" target="_blank" title="Dribbble">Dribbble</a> when possible.

        <p>
          DuoTone Snow is a Atom Syntax theme based on the DuoTone theme from Simurai. As I was unable to find a white theme I liked and really wanted to work with a light theme as it is easier on the eyes, I decided to create one myself.
